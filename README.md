# Command_line ( node js )
This is a convenient command-line replacement for Linux and MacOS. In the future it will appear on windows.


# Beta Version 
In the future, some unstable features will not be publicly available, but only in beta versions, meaning only VIP users can use these features.

# Accounts
It is possible to create accounts with a hashed password, that is, even through the "accounts.json" files, it is not possible to understand which password is used. The password must also consist of at least 6 characters. I have removed other functions so far as the project is still under development.

# Command_Line by C++
Follow this link (https://github.com/NeuroTee/command_line) you can find almost the same command_line, but it is written in C++ and will no longer receive any updates. So use the JavaScript version.
